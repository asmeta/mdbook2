# Function Declarations


To declare an ASM function
it is necessary to specify the name, the domain, and the codomain of the function. Moreover, the function name must be preceded by one of the
keywords **static**, **dynamic** or **derived**,
depending on its kind. Dynamic functions are further classified in **monitored**, **controlled**, **shared**, **out** and **local**.
Local dynamic functions are not considered part of the signature; they are
declared and used only in the scope of a turbo transition rule with "local
state" (see section [Transition rules](#rules)).

The schema below shows the
concrete syntax for declaring a function F (the name) from D (the domain)
to C (the codomain). 0-ary functions  (nullary function) (state varibales) have only the codomain.

| **Model element** | **Concrete syntax** |
| --- | --- |
| **StaticFunction** | **static** F : [ D -> ] C |
| **DynamicFunction** | [ **dynamic** ] ( **monitored** \| **controlled**\| **shared** \| **out**\| **local** ) F **:** [ D **->** ] C  A dynamic function is declared specifying its  kind (*monitored*, *controlled*, *shared*, or *out*);  optionally, the keyword **dynamic** can be also added as prefix. *Local*  dynamic functions can be declared only in the scope of a turbo transition  rule with local state (see section [Transition rules](#rules)). |
| **DerivedFunction** | **derived** F **:** [ D **->** ] C |

> **_NOTE:_**  *derived* functions can contain in their definition both static and dynamic (and derived) functions (but they must contains at least a dynamic function), while *static* functions cannot contain in their definition dynamic or derived  functions.

### Examples

A static function that given two integers return the max of them

``` asmetal
static max: Prod(Integer,Integer) -> Integer
```

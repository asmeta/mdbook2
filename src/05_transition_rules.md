# Transition Rules

In a given state, a
transition rule of an ASM produces for each variable assignment an update set
for some dynamic functions of the signature. We classify transition rules in
two groups: *basic rules* and *turbo rules*. The former are
simply rules, like the *skip rule* and the *update rule*, while
the latter are rules, like the *sequence rule* and the *iterate rule*,
introduced to support practical composition and structuring principles of the ASMs. Other rule schemes are derived from the basic and the
turbo rules.

#### SkipRule
**`skip`** 
#### UpdateRule
**`l:=t`**    
where:  
- t is a generic term.
- l can be either a location term f(t1,...,tn) or a location variable (like `$x`).      
Note that all the rules which return a value t, contain an update rule as in `result:=t`, where `result` is a reserved 0-ary function  acting as placeholder in which to store the intended return value. 

#### BlockRule
**`par`** R1 R2 ... Rn **`endpar`**  
where R1,R2,...,Rn are transition rules. 

#### ConditionalRule
**`if`** G **`then`** Rthen [**`else`** Relse] **`endif`**  
where:  
- G is a term representing a boolean condition.
- Rthen and Relse are transition rules. If Relse is omitted it  is assumed "**else skip**" as default.
